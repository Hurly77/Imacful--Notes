# The Open-Closed Principle 

The open closed Principle or OCP for short states that

> A (class, module, function, etc) should be **open** to extension but **closed** to modification. 

This means that we should not have to modify our code in order to make it work with for further functionality. Every class should have a base set of functionality that is streamlined for every use case. 

Below we have a Class for video game plat form.

```js
const arrayOfPlayforms = ["PS4", "PS5", "Nintendo"]

class Platform {
    playGame(){}
    
    addPlatform(){}
    
    useController(){}
    
    findPlatfrom(){
        //platfrom doesNot exist
    }
    
    getGames(){
        //we'd have and array of all games of all playforms
    }
    
    addGame(){
        //not all games are availbe for all plat forms
    }
}
```

The problem we have here is that some of the functionality would have to be modified in order for all methods to work for all platforms which would not only violate the SRP but also it would violate the OCP. That is why we use sub classes.

```js
class Platform {
    playGame(){}
    
    findPlatfrom(game){
        if(allPlatForms.includes(platform)){
            return platform
        } else {
            addPlatform()
        }
    }
    
    addPlatform(platform){
        allPlatforms.push(platform)
    }
}

class PlatformGame extends Platform {
    findGames(game){
        if(allGames.includes(game)){
            return game
        } else {
            addGame(game)
        }
    }
    
    addGame(game){
        allGames.push(game)
    }
}
```

This way we wonâ€™t have to modify any class methods to introduce new functionality to our class.
