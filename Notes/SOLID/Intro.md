# What is The Solid Principle?

In this section I will be Introducing you to the **SOLID** Principle. S.O.L.D is an  mnemonic acronym which stands for

- **`S`** - Single Responsibility Principle.
- **`O `**- Open-Closed Principle.
- **`L `** - Liskov - Substitution Principle.
- **`I`** - Interface segregation Principle.
- **`D` **- Dependency Inversion Principle.

S.O.L.I.D, which I will now just refer to as **SOLID** , is a very import design principle that is very popular for OOP programming. Every Developer should understand all these principles as it is a key concept for any software engineer. 

All design patterns and principles contribute greatly to writting not only good code but also clean code. However if  you were to only learn two of them go with **`S`** - Single Responsibility Principle and **`O `**- Open-Closed Principle. The `S & O` in SOLID are perhaps the most widely used principles and are also the most effective for building robust and maintainable software. 

Okay Now that you have been given an Idea on what The SOLID principles are lets start learning them. I’d suggest going in order Starting with S and  ending with D. You’ll find the descript of Solid in The `SOLID/SRP.md` file.
