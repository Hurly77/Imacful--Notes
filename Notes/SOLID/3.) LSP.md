# The Liskov Substitution Principle

The Liskov Substitution Principle states that  

> Objects should be  **replaced** with **instances of their subclasses without altering the behavior**.

What this means is that if  we have a base class it should not extend method to classes that cannot or won’t accept it’s parent class methods.

A good example that I found off Academind.com

```js
class Bird {  
    fly(){
        //..
    }
}

class Eagle extends Bird {
    dive(){
        //..
    }
}

const eagle = new Eagle();
eagle.fly();
eagle.dive();

class Penguin extends Bird(){
   //Problem: Can't fly! 
}
```

```js
class Bird {
  layEgg () {}
}

class FlyingBird {
  fly () {}
}

class SwimmingBird extends Bird {
  swim () {}
}

class Eagle extends FlyingBird {}

class Penguin extends Bird {}

const penguin = new Penguin();
penguin.swim();
penguin.layEgg();

const eagle = new Eagle();
eagle.fly();
eagle.layEgg();
```
