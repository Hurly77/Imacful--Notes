# Single Responsibility Principle

In this section will go over the Single Responsibility Principle or **SRP** for short. With the SRP applies to classes, components, and microservices. The main rule for SRP is that :

>  “classes should have  a **single responsibility** - a class shouldn’t **change for more than one reason**.”

SRP, allows for smaller classes over all. One responsibility means less possible reasons we’d need to adjust the code when we run into new problems.

Lets review an example I pulled of `freecodecamp.org`

```js
//bad
class UserSettings {
  constructor (user) {
    this.user = user;
  }

  changeSettings (settings) {
    if (this.verifyCredentials()) {
      //..
    }
  }

  verifyCredentials () {
    //..
  }
}

//Good
class UserAuth {
  constructor (user) {
    this.user = user;
  }

  verifyCredentials () {
    //..
  }
}

class UserSettings {
  cosntructor (user) {
    this.user = user;
    this.auth = new UserAuth(user);
  }

  changeSettings (settings) {
    if (this.auth.verifyCredintials()) {
      //..
    }
  }
}
```
